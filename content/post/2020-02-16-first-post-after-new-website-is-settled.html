<p>This is the first post I create afte the website is settled.</p>
<p>Today is Sunday 2-16-2020. Alex and I went to soccer game this morning to cheer up my teammate. Luckily, our team won 4:1. I was injuired hitting by a 300 lbs guy with full speed on my chest 2 weeks ago. So, I couldnâ€™t dressed up and played today.</p>
<p>But Alex and I had a great time this morning. We kicked soccer balls to each other. Alex made a couple of shots to the goal. I am so proud of him.</p>
<p>Alex really enjoy playing soccer! I wish he improve his skill fast.</p>
