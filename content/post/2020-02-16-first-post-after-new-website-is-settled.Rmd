This is the first post I create afte the website is settled. 

Today is Sunday 2-16-2020. Alex and I went to soccer game this morning to cheer up my teammate. Luckily, our team won 4:1. I was injuired hitting by a 300 lbs guy with full speed on my chest 2 weeks ago. So, I couldn't dressed up and played today.

But Alex and I had a great time this morning. We kicked soccer balls to each other. Alex made a couple of shots to the goal. I am so proud of him.
