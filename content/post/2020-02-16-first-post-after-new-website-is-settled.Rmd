This is the first post I create afte the website is settled. 

Today is Sunday 2-16-2020. Alex and I went to soccer game this morning to cheer up my teammate. Luckily, our team won 4:1. I was injuired hitting by a 300 lbs guy with full speed on my chest 2 weeks ago. So, I couldn't dressed up and played today. 


```{r fig1, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.pos='h', fig.cap='Alex and I playing soccer',echo = FALSE}

    knitr::include_graphics("/images/post/Alex_me_play.jpg")

```

But Alex and I had a great time this morning. We kicked soccer balls to each other. Alex made a couple of shots to the goal. I am so proud of him.



```{r fig2, out.width='35%', fig.align='center', fig.pos='h', fig.cap='Alex is kicking',echo = FALSE, out.extra="style='transform:rotate(90deg);'"}

    knitr::include_graphics("/images/post/Alex1.jpg")
