## A little bit History

I started to learn R markdown since 2018. 

```{r fig1, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.pos='h', fig.cap='R Markdown',echo = FALSE}

    knitr::include_graphics("/images/post/Tinytex/rmarkdown.jpg")

```

After attending RStudio conference 2019 @Austin, I decided write my tech report for project in **R markdown**.

```{r fig2, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.pos='h', fig.cap='RStudio Conf 2019',echo = FALSE}

    knitr::include_graphics("/images/post/Tinytex/rstudio_cof2019.jpg")

```

Although it's a tough process, I finally nailed it and wrote at least 2 tech report in Rmarkdown then produced the final tech report in **PDF** for client.

## Year 2020 Story

Then, we are getting into year 2020. Clients asked us to update tech report for this year. I was so confident at the beginning, thinking what I need to do are changing the parameters and hitting the **knit** button. 

Then, **the reality hit me**.

I was unable to knit any rmarkdown file to PDF document and a lengthy error message showed up. 
Here is the error message.

```{r fig3, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.pos='h', fig.cap='Can't knit PDF error',echo = FALSE}

    knitr::include_graphics("/images/post/Tinytex/screen1.jpg")

```

OK, fine! Let's **debugging**.

I first went to search the [**stackoverflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/) and found that after version 1.8, Rmarkdown automatically connects to package-TinyTex. 

Then I went to [TinyTex webpage](https://yihui.org/tinytex/r/) and it seems like there are some answers to my problem.


```{r fig4, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.pos='h', fig.cap='TinyTex',echo = FALSE}

    knitr::include_graphics("/images/post/Tinytex/tinytex.jpg")

```
I started to try different solutions and even created an [R code](/images/post/Tinytex/tinytex_install_code.R) for the TinyTex debugging. 

After more than 2 days trials, I thought it might be a good idea to post my issue to the online community so that the expert (probably Yihui himself) could help me out. 

[My question post](https://community.rstudio.com/t/tinytex-isnt-working-and-cant-generate-pdf-file-in-rmarkdown/53916)

After 12 hours, I even received Yihui's reply--> Oh Yeah!

```{r fig5, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.pos='h', fig.cap='Yihui's reply',echo = FALSE}

    knitr::include_graphics("/images/post/Tinytex/yihui.jpg")

```

However, nothing really worked out:( 

my Rstudio constantly received this error message.

```{r fig6, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.pos='h', fig.cap='What a creepy error',echo = FALSE}

    knitr::include_graphics("/images/post/Tinytex/screen2.jpg")

```

Alright then! I came and I tried. Now it's time to move on and reinstall the entire WINDOWS system, I guess. 

The possible root cause might be I have installed multiple versions of Latex distribution in the past. 

But anyway, it's a good debugging experience and at least, I let my patience play out entire process. 

```{r fig7, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.pos='h', fig.cap='What a creepy error',echo = FALSE}

    knitr::include_graphics("/images/post/Tinytex/nothing.jpg")

```
