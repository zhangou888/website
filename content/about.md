Hello!

I’m Ou Zhang, a Data Scientist, Research Scientist, and Psychometrician. 

I graduated from University of Florida in 2012 with a Ph.D. degree in psychometrics and statistics. I currently work with the psychometrics service team at Pearson, where I focus on data science, psychometrics modeling and analysis, testing development, and consulting. I’m also the data geek with R, Python and SAS. 

I have previously worked at clinical assessment branch at Pearson, playing a key role in multiple flagship clinical assessment products, including WISC-5, GFTA-3, KLPA-3, Quotient ADHD diagnosis test, TEACH-2 Behavior test. Outside of psychometrics and statistical modeling, I’ve also been a data scientist and a R programming educator.

I’m interested in data science, machine learning, and natural language process.
